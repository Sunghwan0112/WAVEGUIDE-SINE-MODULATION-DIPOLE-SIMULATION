# Ansys Waveguide Modulation with Python Automation :computer:

## Description :page_with_curl:
This GitHub repository hosts the source code and accompanying documentation for an advanced simulation project that leverages Ansys Lumerical software and Python. The project is dedicated to optimizing waveguide structures for efficient light propagation, employing sine wave grating techniques. It encompasses two primary components: automated Ansys simulations for precise structural adjustments and Python-based Dipole simulations for validating theoretical models.
## Features :sparkles:
- **Automated Structural Modifications**: Leverage the Ansys Lumerical Python API to automatically adjust waveguide dimensions to meet precise specifications.

- **Material and Design Specifications**:
  - Waveguide Core: The core material, featuring a refractive index of 2.0, is modulated with subtle sine wave variations.
  - Supporting Structure: SiO2 box with a refractive index of 1.44 to isolate the waveguide.
- **Simulation Techniques**:
  - **Mode Injection**: Use of Port 2 to inject light modes with minimal refractive index leakage.
  - **Data Acquisition**: Capture E-field data at Port 1 using ANSYS Lumerical FDTD for comprehensive analysis.
  - **Grating Modulation**: Control over the waveguideâ€™s modulation via variables like K_grating and x_span.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluate different grating shapes to ascertain the most efficient pattern in terms of optical diffraction efficiency.
